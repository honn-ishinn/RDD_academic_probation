# Lack of Evidence?: Academic Probation Does Not Affect Student Dropout and Subsequent Performance

This repo is the replication study of `Lindo, Jason M, Nicholas J Sanders, and Philip Oreopoulos. “Ability, Gender, and Performance Standards: Evidence from Academic Probation.”` It uses a sharp regression discontinuity design to examine students' responses after being placed on academic probation (i.e. GPA below a certain cutoff point) at the end of the first academic year in a large Canadian University.

# Abstract

Many universities use academic probation as a wake-up call to ensure currently enrolled students to achieve minimum academic standards. This paper examines the causal impact on first-year students' responses in a Canadian university after being placed on academic probation in a sharp regression discontinuity design. With adjusted bandwidth (i.e., student within certain GPA of the academic probation cutoff), the results do not suggest that placing first year students on academic probation affects the dropout decision, subsequent annual GPA and graduation. While there are heterogeneous responses across students' highschool performance, gender, first language towards academic probation.
