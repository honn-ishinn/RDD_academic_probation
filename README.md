# Effect of Academic Probation on University Students

This repo is the replication exercise of `Lindo, Jason M, Nicholas J Sanders, and Philip Oreopoulos. “Ability, Gender, and Performance Standards: Evidence from Academic Probation.”` It uses a sharp regression discontinuity design to examine students' responses after being placed on academic probation (i.e. GPA below a certain cutoff point) at the end of the first academic year in a large Canadian University.
